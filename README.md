# TidelabNewsBlog
This a project is a news blog website that was assigned to myself and some other students as a group during a six-weeks software development course.
The website was built with html and css and was hosted on netlify.
I built the responsive header, footer and contact page of the website.
While working as a contributor to this project, I learnt how to; collaborate with github, push to my own github branch and how to create a pull request.![Screenshot (21)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67491400/162691300-c8237e26-97f0-4e3f-b669-edac6581b3a1.png)
